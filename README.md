# Classification

The goal of this project is to familiarize with classification problems. More specifically the objective is to use different
geographic and geological variables to predict the type of tree found in a particular area of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado. 
The data can be found here:

The variable Cover_Type is what you are trying to predict. Due to performance issues the dataset was subsampled and a train and test 
set were used with roughly the same distribution for the Cover_Type as in the original dataset.

The models used for the classification problem were:
1) Decision Trees
2) Random Forest
